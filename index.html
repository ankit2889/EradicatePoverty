<h2> This weekend<sup>'</sup>s special brunch </h2>
<p> This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
four eggs in the pan at a time. </p>
